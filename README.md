Symfony bundle for further Monolog, Sentry and Graylog integration.

## Why?

Monolog already offers integration with both Sentry and Graylog. This bundle re-uses those integrations, adding
the following features:
- clearer formatting for Graylog messages;
- adds correlation_id to correlate messages in Sentry with messages in Graylog from the same process;
- allows grouping some exceptions by their class, independently from where they were thrown at or what are their message;
- removes root prefix from messages (usually included in some exception messages);
- maps context to be available with logged sentry event. 

Also recommended configuration is given to allow nice synergy between Graylog and Sentry.

## Installation

```bash
composer require symfony/monolog-bundle sentry/sentry-symfony paysera/lib-logging-extra-bundle
```

Register installed bundles in your kernel or `bundles.php` file, if not installed automatically by flex.

## Configuration

This is recommended configuration for all three bundles.
This ensures that:
- `INFO` and above level log messages always goes to Graylog;
- in case `ERROR` and above level log message is received, all messages (even `DEBUG`, but maximum 50) goes to Graylog.
This helps to debug any problems as you get much more information about what has happened;
- `ERROR` level log messages goes to Sentry, so you can see any errors occurring in your application;
- logging does not break or impact your application, even if your Sentry or Graylog servers are down:
  - Graylog uses UDP, so no need to wait for responses. Handler is also wrapped in a failsafe to avoid any errors
  on DNS resolution impacting your application;
  - Sentry uses HTTP, but has error handling by default, also sends the messages on process shutdown; configuration
  overrides default 3 retries to just one – if sentry is overwhelmed with requests already, no need to send any
  more messages 3 times in a row;
- messages are visible on console. You can pass arguments to any command for further verbosity level to see INFO
or even DEBUG log messages.

```yaml

monolog:
    handlers:
        info:
            type: filter
            accepted_levels: [INFO, NOTICE, WARNING]
            handler: graylog_failsafe
        debug_and_errors:
            type: filter
            accepted_levels: [DEBUG, ERROR, CRITICAL, ALERT, EMERGENCY]
            handler: graylog_fingers_crossed
        console:
            type: console
            process_psr_3_messages: false
            channels: ["!event", "!doctrine"]
        sentry:
            type: service
            id: paysera_logging_extra.sentry_handler
        graylog_fingers_crossed:
            type: fingers_crossed
            action_level: error
            handler: graylog_failsafe
            stop_buffering: false
            buffer_size: 50
            nested: true
        graylog_failsafe:
            type: whatfailuregroup
            members: [graylog]
            nested: true
        graylog:
            type: gelf
            publisher:
                hostname: '%env(GRAYLOG_HOSTNAME)%'
                port: '%env(GRAYLOG_PORT)%'
                chunk_size: 8154
            formatter: paysera_logging_extra.formatter.gelf_message     # registered by the bundle
            nested: true

sentry:
    dsn: '%env(SENTRY_DSN)%'
    register_error_listener: false
    tracing:
        enabled: false # If using self-hosted Sentry version < v20.6.0
    options:
        environment: '%kernel.environment%'
        release: '%env(VERSION)%' # your app version, optional

paysera_logging_extra:
  application_name: app-something   # customise this to know which project message was sent from
```

## Usage

Log with INFO level and above to get messages in Graylog.

Log with ERROR level and above to get messages in Sentry.

Log with DEBUG level to get messages in Graylog in case any error occurs in the same request / process.
To find those, start with error in Sentry and search messages in Graylog by provided `correlation_id`.

## Semantic versioning

This bundle follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Public API of this bundle (in other words, you should only use these features if you want to easily update
to new versions):
- only services that are not marked as `public="false"`;
- only classes, interfaces and class methods that are marked with `@api`;
- console commands;
- supported DIC tags.

For example, if only class method is marked with `@api`, you should not extend that class, as constructor
could change in any release.

See [Symfony BC rules](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/bc.html) for basic information
about what can be changed and what not in the API. Keep in mind, that in this bundle everything is
`@internal` by default.

## Running tests

```
composer update
composer test
```

## Contributing

Feel free to create issues and give pull requests.

### Running dependencies locally

```
cd example
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec sentry sentry upgrade
```

You'll find Graylog at [http://localhost:9001/](http://localhost:9001/) and Sentry at 
[http://localhost:9002/](http://localhost:9002/).

Open Graylog, login with `admin` `admin`, choose `System` -> `Inputs` -> `GELF UDP` -> `Launch new input` ->
input any title and select the node -> `Save`.

Open Sentry, login with user created by the last command, choose `Installation instructions` -> `Symfony2` ->
copy the credentials part (protocol, hostname and port might be missing).
Run following command, exchanging `HERE_GOES_CREDENTIALS` with real credentials:

```
export SENTRY_DSN=http://HERE_GOES_CREDENTIALS@localhost:9002/1
```

And run test PHP script:

```
php test.php
```

View logged data in Graylog and Sentry instances. Change the code for further
test scenarios or just use Graylog and Sentry to set-up and test your real 
project.

Cleanup afterwards:

```
docker-compose down
```
